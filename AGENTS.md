# Architecture rules

- Resolve checkout postal addresses through `src/lib/postal-address.ts`; centralizing provider fallback keeps automatic and manual CEP input consistent.
- Editorial packaging uses a shared story rendered through the PDP registry; the admin synchronizes its institutional page to keep the two surfaces aligned.
- After-sales rules live outside product-save payloads, keyed by product ID or global scope; follow-ups remain blocked until sending prerequisites exist, preventing accidental customer emails.
