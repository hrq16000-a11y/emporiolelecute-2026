# Architecture rules

- Resolve checkout postal addresses through `src/lib/postal-address.ts`; centralizing provider fallback keeps automatic and manual CEP input consistent.
- Editorial packaging uses a shared story rendered through the PDP registry; the admin synchronizes its institutional page to keep the two surfaces aligned.
- After-sales rules live outside product-save payloads, keyed by product ID or global scope; follow-ups remain blocked until sending prerequisites exist, preventing accidental customer emails.
- Search boost previews use an admin-only, read-only ranking RPC derived from the public search function; keep both rankers aligned when search semantics change, and require a fresh draft preview before UI publication.
- Global SEO uses existing seo_config and robots_config records; sitemap counts parse page URL nodes from actual XML and distinguish generated XML from published static artifacts.
- Operational policy is admin-only; unresolved high regressions remain blocked across repeated scans until approval or verified resolution, and scheduled workers authenticate with private database credentials.
- Image retries use a role-checked RPC; service-only leased claims fence completion and reclaim interrupted work, while clients cannot directly update job state.
