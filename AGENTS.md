# Architecture rules

- Resolve checkout postal addresses through `src/lib/postal-address.ts`; centralizing provider fallback keeps automatic and manual CEP input consistent.
- Editorial packaging uses a shared story rendered through the PDP registry; the admin synchronizes its institutional page to keep the two surfaces aligned.
- After-sales rules live outside product-save payloads, keyed by product ID or global scope; follow-ups remain blocked until sending prerequisites exist, preventing accidental customer emails.
- Search boost previews use an admin-only, read-only ranking RPC derived from the public search function; keep both rankers aligned when search semantics change, and require a fresh draft preview before UI publication.
- Global SEO uses existing seo_config and robots_config records; sitemap counts parse page URL nodes from actual XML and distinguish generated XML from published static artifacts.
- Operational policy is admin-only; database statement triggers enforce scan-specific catalog approvals across products and taxonomy links, including service-role writes, and a daily job applies Lighthouse history retention.
- Image retries reset eligible failed jobs through a role-checked RPC; worker claims are conditional to avoid concurrent processing, with polling as a realtime fallback.
